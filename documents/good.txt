After hearing the quote above, I started paying attention to how I did things.

Did I do them too fast? Did I lose focus? Did I hesitate? Did I have a good attitude? Did I give 100%? I realized that the quote really is true for me. How I did one thing was how I did everything.

That’s what this list is about. Figuring out how you do things and how you can do them better.

Here’s a list of 19 ways to be a better person and become the best version of yourself.

1. Define your vision and set goals – yearly, monthly, weekly, and daily
Having a vision for your life, on which you can set goals, is so important to being happy. You’ll know your “why” and you’ll intentionally move in the direction you want your life to move toward. Having goals that are in line with your vision will help you achieve what you want in life, whether it’s for your family, career, or anything in between.

Check out Grow You, which is my coaching program where I have coached thousands of women on things such a mindset, money, relationships, and intentional living.

This is how I personally started what I did when I quit my job as a lawyer to become a financial planner and blogger-now online business entrepreneur and life coach. Now, I make money doing what I love. I never would’ve imagined it was possible to make money online – it’s truly been a blessing!

2. Commit to lifelong learning
When you learn, you grow. And like Tony Robbins said, “if you’re not growing you’re dying.” Intentional living means continuing to learn and grow.

Be the type of person who wants to always learn. Personal growth will improve your entire life and how you view the world.

Here’s a list of all the podcasts and books I recommend.

3. Read daily
One of the easiest ways to learn is to read.

By reading every day, you’ll absorb new information and grow yourself mentally and improve your mental health.

Here are a few book lists to get you started: 1) money books, 2) personal development books, and 3) blogging books.
